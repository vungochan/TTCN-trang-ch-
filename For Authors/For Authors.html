          agricultural sciences including crop science, plant protection, animal
          science, veterinary medicine, aquaculture, mechanical and electrical
          engineering, soil science and plant nutrition, ecology and
          environment, biotechnology, food technology, economics and rural

          ).
        </p>
        <p>
          Manuscripts should be prepared in MS Word using a 12 point Times New
          Roman font, be single spaced with 3-cm left and right margins, 2.5-cm
          top and bottom margins; and “justified”. Research articles (including
          references, tables and figures) should be around 6000 words in length
          (technical fields) or 7000 words in length (socio-economic fields).

          The title of the article must reflect the content of the paper. It
          must be concise and informative, contains the high-frequency words and
          illustrates key words. The first letter of each word in the title must
          be capitalized except for articles, prepositions, and conjunctions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abstract should state the objectives of the research, main
          methodologies, research results and major conclusions. The length of

          The symbols and exponents are clearly presented, and noted from the
          first use. Plants, insects, animals and microorganisms, when presented
          for the first time in abstracts and articles, should be accompanied by
          their scientific names (Latin double names). For land terminology, the
          International Classification System (FAO-UNESCO) or the US Department
          of Agriculture (USDA) Classification System can be used as a reference
          document when presenting the local classification system. Math
          equations: please use Equation. Chemical formulations: the ionic
          chemistry should be specified as Ca2+ or SO42- , not as Ca++ or SO4—.
          The number of radioactive isotopes must be written before the symbol,
          for example: 18O or 15(NH4)2SO4. As for the statistical significance,
          please specify the corresponding level of significance.

          Tables and figures will appear in the published article in the order
          in which they are numbered initially. Table titles should be put above

          corresponding text citation. Each text citation must include at least
          two pieces of information, author(s) and year of publication. Example
          for citations: with one author: Smith (1995) or (Smith, 1995); with

          experts in their fields and should be able to provide a rigorous

          To partially cover the cost of publication, authors are required to
          pay an Article Processing Charge (APC) of 500,000 VND (approximately
          22 USD) for manuscripts accepted after the pre-check by the managing
          editor. However, the APC is waived for authors who are residing and
          working outside of Vietnam. There are no charges for rejected articles
          after the pre-check, no submission fees, and no additional fees based
          on the length of the article, number of figures, or supplementary
          data. Editorial items (such as Editorials, Corrections, Additions,
          Retractions, Letters, Comments, etc.) are published free of charge.

          After receiving the manuscripts, the Editorial Board Members will send
          them to reviewers and ensure the review process will last for no
          longer than two months; however, in some cases, it might last longer
          depending on the availability of reviewers. VJAS has carried out a
          double blind peer review policy in which names of reviewers and
          authors are not revealed to each other. The Editorial Board will
          inform to the authors the specific reasons for the rejection of a
          manuscript. In some special cases, especially when the manuscript
          contains new information or is of a hot topic to the scholarly
          society, the research article can be recommended to be rewritten into
          a short communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the manuscript is accepted for publication, the Editorial Board
          will also reply to the authors and give them a certain time to revise
          the article depending on the quality of the manuscript. The final
          revised manuscript will be considered to be the original article. The
          manuscript will be batched for publication in an upcoming issue of the
          journal.
        </p>

          After the publication, each first author will receive a free printed

      <div class="title-1">The key rules of creating a references list</div>
      <div class="Content">
        <p>
          Your references should be at the end of your article with the title
          References put at the very top. Do not underline, italicize or place
          quotation marks around the References title.
        </p>
        <p>Alphabetize entries by authors’ last names.</p>
        <p>
          Create a hanging indent for each individual source you add to the
          list. A hanging indent is where the second and all the following lines
          of a paragraph are indented more than the first. To make a hanging
          indent, highlight your citation and use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+T
          (hanging indent by 0.7cm).
        </p>
        <p>
          In article titles, only the first letter should be capitalized. The
          title should not be placed in quotations, underlined or italicized.
        </p>
        <p>
          All major words in the title of a journal should be capitalized; i.e.
          International Food Research Journal.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case where the same author is cited multiple times for
          different works, start by listing these references in chronological
          order with the oldest reference appearing first and working your way
          up to the most recent one.
