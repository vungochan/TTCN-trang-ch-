          As a double-blind peer reviewer for Vietnam Journal of Agricultural
          Sciences (VJAS), you are part of a valued community. Scientific
          progress depends on the communication of information that can be
          trusted, and the peer review process is a vital part of that system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each submitted paper is rigorously reviewed. For an in-depth review,
          at least two reviewers (at least one Vietnamese reviewer and one
          foreign reviewer are consulted). Reviewers are contacted before being
          sent a reviewer account to gain access to a paper on our web-based
          system and are asked to return comments online
          <span>within 2 weeks</span> for most papers by logging in with the
          provided account. As part of the assessment, reviewers will be asked
          to provide a detailed,
          <span>provide a detailed, constructive review report</span> and if
          possible <span>detailed comments on the manuscript</span> file to
          provide the best guide for the author(s) to improve the quality of
          their paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          We greatly appreciate the time spent in preparing a review and will
          consult you on a revision of a manuscript if needed. The final
          responsibility for decisions of acceptance or rejection of the
          manuscript lies with the Editorial Board.

      <div class="title-1">Ethical Guidelines for Reviewers</div>
      <div class="Content">
        <p>
          Reviews should be objective evaluations of the research. If you cannot
          judge a paper impartially, you should not accept it for review or you
          should notify the Editor as soon as you appreciate the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, as a reviewer, you believe that you are not qualified to evaluate
          a component of the research, you should inform the Editor in your
          review.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reviews should be constructive and courteous and the reviewer should
          respect the intellectual independence of the author. The reviewer
          should avoid personal comments; Vietnam Journal of Agricultural
          Sciencesreserves the right to edit out comments that will hinder
          constructive discussion of manuscripts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as you wish prompt evaluations of your own research, please
          return your reviews within the time period specified when you were
          asked to review the paper. If events will prevent a timely review, it
          is your responsibility to inform the Editor at the time of the
          request.
        </p>
        <p>
          The review process is conducted anonymously; Vietnam Journal of
          Agricultural Sciencesnever reveals the identity of reviewers to
          authors. The privacy and anonymity provisions of this process extend
          to the reviewer, who should not reveal his or her identity to
          outsiders or members of the press. The review itself will be shared
          only with the author, and possibly with other reviewers and our
          Editorial Board.
        </p>
        <p>
          The submitted manuscript is a privileged communication and must be
          treated as a confidential document. Please destroy or delete all
          copies of the manuscript after review. Please do not share the
          manuscript with any colleagues without the explicit permission of the
          Editor. Reviewers should not make personal or professional use of the
          data or interpretations before publication without the authors'
          specific permission (unless you are writing an editorial or commentary
          to accompany the article).
